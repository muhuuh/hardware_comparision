## Key Considerations for AI Inference Workloads

### VRAM Capacity
- **High Priority**: Larger AI models require more VRAM
- 16GB+ recommended for most modern AI models
- 24GB+ (RTX 4090/5090) allows running larger models without quantization

### Inference Speed
- **High Priority**: Affects productivity and throughput
- RTX 5090 > RTX 5080 > RTX 4090 > RTX 4080 SUPER > RTX 4080 > RTX 4070 Ti SUPER

### System RAM
- **Medium Priority**: Affects data preprocessing and handling
- 32GB minimum recommended, 64GB+ preferred for larger datasets

### CPU Performance
- **Medium Priority**: Important for data preparation and non-GPU tasks
- Multi-core performance benefits parallel preprocessing

### Storage
- **Medium Priority**: Affects model loading times and dataset access
- NVMe SSD recommended for primary storage

### Cooling and Power Supply
- **Medium Priority**: Ensures sustained performance under load
- Better cooling allows GPUs to maintain higher clock speeds

### Upgradability
- **Low to Medium Priority**: Future-proofing for evolving AI requirements
- Non-proprietary components offer better upgrade paths

### Budget Considerations
- RTX 4070 Ti/4070 Ti SUPER systems offer the best value within €2500
- RTX 5080/5090 systems provide better performance but exceed budget
- Consider long-term usage and productivity gains vs. initial cost
