# Hardware Requirements for AI Model Inference

Based on research from Puget Systems and other sources, here are the key hardware requirements for running AI models locally for inference (not training):

## GPU Requirements

- **Manufacturer**: NVIDIA dominates the market for AI acceleration and is the most supported and easiest to work with
- **Recommended Models**: 
  - Consumer cards: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 and 5090 give very good performance
  - Professional cards: RTX 5000 Ada and 6000 Ada work well in multi-GPU configurations
- **VRAM Requirements**: 
  - Minimum: 8GB (could be limiting for many applications)
  - Common: 12-24GB (available on high-end consumer cards)
  - For larger data: 48GB (available on NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada)
- **Multi-GPU Considerations**: 
  - A single high-end GPU like RTX 5090 or 6000 Ada can be sufficient for many applications
  - Multiple GPUs can provide significant performance benefits if supported by the framework
  - Consumer cards like RTX 5080/5090 may be difficult to configure in multi-GPU systems due to cooling design and physical size

## CPU Requirements

- **Recommended Platforms**: Intel Xeon W and AMD Threadripper Pro (for workstations)
  - For desktop systems within €2500 budget, high-end consumer CPUs are more appropriate
- **Core Count**: 
  - Rule of thumb: At least 4 cores for each GPU accelerator
  - Minimum: 16 cores for AI workstations
  - For significant CPU compute: 32 or even 64 cores could be ideal
- **PCI-Express Lanes**: Important for multi-GPU setups, less critical for single-GPU systems

## RAM Requirements

- **Capacity Rule of Thumb**: At least double the amount of total GPU VRAM in the system
  - Example: System with 24GB VRAM GPU should have at least 48GB RAM
- **Data Analysis Considerations**: 
  - Ability to load full datasets into memory is often necessary
  - For extensive data analysis, requirements could reach 64GB or more

## Storage Requirements

- **Primary Storage**: 
  - Fast NVMe storage recommended for data streaming (up to 4TB capacity)
  - Data streaming speeds can become a bottleneck when data is too large for system memory
- **Secondary Storage**: 
  - SATA-based SSDs offer larger capacities (8TB commonly available)
  - Useful for data that exceeds capacity of typical NVMe drives
- **Archival Storage**: 
  - Platter drives can be used for very large data sets (18TB+ capacities available)
- **RAID Configurations**: 
  - Can provide additional storage space (10s to 100s of terabytes)
  - Adds complexity and may use slots that could otherwise support additional GPUs

## Specific Considerations for Inference Workloads

- Inference typically requires less computational power than training
- Single precision (FP32) is sufficient for most inference workloads
- Tensor cores (FP16) with mixed precision can offer significant performance gains
- For inference-only workloads, consumer GPUs like RTX 5080/5090 are excellent choices
- NVLink (for connecting multiple GPUs) is generally not needed for inference workloads unless working with models that have "history" components

## Budget Considerations for €2500

- At this price point, focus should be on a system with:
  - High-end consumer CPU (AMD Ryzen or Intel Core)
  - Single powerful GPU with adequate VRAM (RTX 4080/4090 or RTX 5070/5080)
  - 32-64GB of system RAM
  - Fast NVMe storage (1-2TB) + secondary SSD storage
